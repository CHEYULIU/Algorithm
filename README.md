# Algorithm
## In this program, I will present some funny combination of different algorithms such as PCA, K-means etc. The ultimately goal is to provide some common sense about the application of algorithms. 
Besides, it is also the note of my own practicing.

The main programming language I would use is Python. Sometimes I may use VBA to pre-process the data. In each of the instances that I show, I will explain the methods in the way of mathematics I'll use in that program at first. And then describing the question which relates to the method that I used. Finally, to show the codes.
